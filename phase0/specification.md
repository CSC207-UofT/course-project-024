Our project is a program designed to allow users to create, study, and organize flashcards for whatever tasks they would need. At the top-level, users can access their “decks” of flashcards. Decks should be identified by their names, and should be re-nameable. At this level, users should be able to either create a new deck, or perform actions on a selected deck. Actions include renaming the deck, deleting the deck, or starting what is deemed a “study session” on the deck. A study session is a system with an algorithm which displays cards from the deck one-at-a-time to the user. The study session’s algorithm dictates what cards are displayed; examples of algorithms include generating a random card, displaying cards in order of creation, or periodically displaying unseen cards between previously-seen cards to help with learning new decks or practicing decks. Within a deck, users should be able to make changes such as creating a new flashcard (with a custom front and back) and adding it to the deck, editing an existing flashcard, and deleting a card. Users of the program are separated into accounts, which require a log-in, and should have their own decks of flashcards accessible at will and have any progress on their study sessions saved to their account.
